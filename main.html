	<h1>Ladakh</h1>
	<p>The Land of High Passes or Ladakh is one of the most surreal places a tourist visits if they are in the state of Jammu and  Kashmir. Ladakh is picturesque and good for adventure. Most tourists even go for a biking trip to Ladakh as it comes under one of the most beautiful road trips in India. The shades of rocks in  Ladakh also change from one place to another.</p>
